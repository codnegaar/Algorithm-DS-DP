Leetcode BFS 407 Trapping Rain Water II

Given an m x n integer matrix heightMap representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
        Input: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.
        We have two small ponds 1 and 3 units trapped.
        The total volume of water trapped is 4.

Example 2:
        Input: heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]
        Output: 10 

Constraints:
        m == heightMap.length
        n == heightMap[i].length
        1 <= m, n <= 200
        0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 104
