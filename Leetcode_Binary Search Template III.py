'''

Template #3 is another unique form of Binary Search. It is used to search for an element or condition which requires accessing the 
current index and its immediate left and right neighbor's index in the array.

 

Key Attributes:
        An alternative way to implement Binary Search
        Search Condition needs to access element's immediate left and right neighbors
        Use element's neighbors to determine if condition is met and decide whether to go left or right
        Gurantees Search Space is at least 3 in size at each step Post-processing required. 
        Loop/Recursion ends when you have 2 elements left. Need to assess if the remaining elements meet the condition.
 

Distinguishing Syntax:
        Initial Condition: left = 0, right = length-1
        Termination: left + 1 == right
        Searching Left: right = mid
        Searching Right: left = mid
