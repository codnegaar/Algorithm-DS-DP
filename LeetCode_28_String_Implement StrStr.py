Implement strStr().

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

 

Example 1:
        Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
        Output: 2
Example 2:
        Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
        Output: -1

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        
        # Base conditions
        if haystack is None or needle is None:
            return -1
        # Special case
        if haystack == needle:
            return 0
        # Length of the needle
        needleLength = len(needle)
        # Loop through the haystack and slide the window
        for i in range(len(haystack) - needleLength + 1):
            if haystack[i:i + needleLength] == needle:
                return i
        return -1
